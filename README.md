# Dowsing Rod

Dowsing Rod finds structural refactoring opportunities in Python, JavaScript/JSX, TypeScript/TSX, C, C++, C#, Verilog, SystemVerilog, and VHDL. It is a Rust-native scanner with a standalone CLI and Python bindings, built for spotting duplicated flows, repeated procedural logic, adapter/strategy candidates, validation helpers, and other code shapes that ordinary text duplicate detectors miss.

It works offline. Source code is parsed locally, normalized locally, and rendered locally.

## Status

`0.2.2` keeps HDL discovery conservative: Verilog, SystemVerilog, and VHDL units are never refactoring candidates. Preprocessed, UVM/DPI, and newer VHDL syntax recover as an outline for discovery. The scanner remains local-first: parsing, normalization, scoring, caching, and rendering all happen on the machine running it.

## Install

With `uv` (zero install / standalone tool):

```bash
# Run immediately without installing:
uvx dowsing-rod scan .

# Or install into your current environment:
uv pip install dowsing-rod

# Or install as a global CLI tool:
uv tool install dowsing-rod
```

With `pip`:

```bash
pip install dowsing-rod
```

With npm (no Python or compiler required):

```bash
npx dowsing-rod scan .
# or
npm install --global dowsing-rod
```

With .NET:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dowsing-rod
```

From a local checkout:
```bash
pip install .
```

For development:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
```

The project uses PyO3 and maturin for Python packaging. The npm and NuGet launchers select matching prebuilt Rust binaries. Neither has install scripts or runtime downloads.

Prebuilt command-line binaries support macOS x64/arm64, Windows x64, and glibc 2.17+ on Linux x64/arm64. That covers RHEL 8–10, current Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and SUSE releases. See [platform support](docs/platform-support.md) for runtime floors. musl/Alpine and Windows arm64 are not currently provided.

## Quick Start

Scan the current project:

```bash
dowsing-rod scan .
```

Scan a specific file:

```bash
dowsing-rod scan rtl/arbiter.sv
```

Ask for compact output suitable for an LLM prompt:

```bash
dowsing-rod scan . --ai --max-tokens 4000
```

Emit structured JSON:

```bash
dowsing-rod scan . --format json
dowsing-rod scan . --format jsonl
```

## CLI Reference

```bash
dowsing-rod scan [PATH] [OPTIONS]
dowsing-rod cache clear [PATH]
dowsing-rod version
```

Scan options:

```text
--ai                         Use compact AI-oriented output
--format human|json|jsonl    Select output format
--min-similarity FLOAT       Minimum edge similarity, default 0.75
--max-clusters N             Limit reported clusters
--max-tokens N               Token budget for AI output
--normalization LEVEL        strict, balanced, or aggressive
--jobs N                     Rayon worker thread count
--exclude PATTERN...         Additional ignore patterns, space- or comma-separated
--include PATTERN...         Inclusion overrides, space- or comma-separated
--no-cache                   Disable the file analysis cache
--fail-on-error              Return an error when any file fails to parse
```

For several source areas, use either form:

```bash
dowsing-rod scan . --include rtl tb uvm --exclude vendor,generated
```

## Python API

```python
import dowsing_rod

result = dowsing_rod.scan(
    ".",
    min_similarity=0.80,
    normalization="balanced",
    max_clusters=10,
    exclude=["generated", "vendor"],
    no_cache=True,
    fail_on_error=False,
)

for cluster in result["clusters"]:
    print(cluster["id"], cluster["classification"], cluster["average_similarity"])
```

Available functions:

```python
dowsing_rod.scan(path=".", **kwargs) -> dict
dowsing_rod.version() -> str
dowsing_rod.clear_cache(path=".") -> int
```

## Configuration

Dowsing Rod reads `[tool.dowsing-rod]` from `pyproject.toml` or a standalone `dowsing-rod.toml` in the project root.

```toml
[tool.dowsing-rod]
min_similarity = 0.78
normalization = "balanced"
max_clusters = 25
max_tokens = 8000
exclude = ["generated", "vendor", "migrations"]
include = ["src"]
```

CLI flags and Python keyword arguments override file configuration where an override is provided.

## How It Works

The core pipeline is:

```text
discover supported source files
parse Python with RustPython and other languages with embedded Tree-sitter grammars
extract functions, methods, lambdas, HDL tasks/functions, and HDL procedural blocks
normalize scoped structure while preserving calls, member access, operators, literals, and HDL timing/assignment syntax
fingerprint normalized tokens
generate candidate pairs with exact hashes and SimHash LSH
score candidates with multiple similarity signals
build a thresholded graph
cluster connected functions
classify and rank refactoring opportunities
render human, AI, JSON, or JSONL output
```

Normalization is deliberately semantic enough to avoid the most obvious false positives. Calls, member access, operators, control flow, literals, parameter shape, and complexity all contribute to the score. Clusters are isolated by language; JavaScript and TypeScript are separate languages.

HDL is discovery-only. The scanner extracts `always`/`process` blocks, functions, tasks, and procedures, but emits no HDL refactoring clusters. It does not model clock domains, reset trees, widths, elaboration, resource mapping, timing, or simulation semantics. If the embedded grammar cannot represent a Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL file, Dowsing Rod records local declarations as an outline; macro expansions and foreign DPI declarations are omitted. Recovered units are never normalized, scored, or clustered. Use your simulator, linter, or synthesizer for HDL syntax and semantic validation.

See [docs/algorithms.md](docs/algorithms.md) for implementation details.

## Output Schema

JSON output serializes a `ScanResult` with:

```text
schema_version
tool_version
repository
statistics
clusters
functions
parse_errors
```

JSONL output writes one header object followed by one self-contained object per cluster.

## Cache

The scanner stores per-file analysis results in `.dowsing-rod-cache/`. Cache keys include file content, tool version, and normalization level.

```bash
dowsing-rod cache clear .
```

Use `--no-cache` for repeatable benchmarks or debugging.

## Benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench -p dowsing-core
```

Benchmarks cover parsing, extraction, normalization, fingerprinting, candidate generation, and synthetic pipeline scale.

## Releases

The release workflows build and test every package before publishing. PyPI and NuGet use trusted publishing. npm uses trusted publishing after its first release; set a temporary `NPM_TOKEN` in the `npm-release` environment for that bootstrap, configure the publisher for `dowsing-rod` and the five `dowsing-rod-native-*` packages, then delete the token. Configure environment approval before the first release. Dispatch the npm and NuGet workflows from a matching `v<version>` tag with `publish` enabled.

## Comparison With Other Tools

Dowsing Rod is not a linter and does not replace formatters, type checkers, or text-level duplicate detectors.

It is most useful when:

- functions use different names but share the same flow;
- provider implementations repeat the same pipeline with different API calls;
- small validation, serialization, or helper patterns are copied across modules;
- you want a compact, ranked summary to hand to an AI coding assistant.
- you want to keep agent refactors grounded when working in a large, multi-language project.

It is less useful when:

- duplication is purely textual and already obvious;
- code cannot be parsed by its supported language frontend;
- the right abstraction depends on runtime behavior or domain constraints not present in source;
- the project is small enough that you should just do it yourself.

## Privacy

Dowsing Rod does not call external services. It reads local source files, writes an optional local cache, and emits local output. The `--ai` format is only a compact text rendering; it does not send code to any model.
